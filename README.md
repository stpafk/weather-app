    Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
    Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
    Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
    Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
    Display the information on your webpage!
    Add any styling you like!
    Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
    Push that baby to github and share your solution below!

* My review

This was a fun project to do because I learned (by having several problems lmao) how to handle an API correctly, including understanding status codes, how to correctly make a request and how to load that data.

At first, I wrote all the code with pure JS, as I was first learning everything. But then, I decide to refactor everything using React and also give a proper look to the page (the first design was very poor...)
